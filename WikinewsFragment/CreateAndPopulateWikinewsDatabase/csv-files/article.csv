relacionadas ao programa apenas seis auditores internos da onu foram inicialmente designados para fiscalizar programa petróleoporcomida recomendações da onu dizem que pelo menos auditores devem trabalhar na fiscalização de programas que gastam mais de bilhão de dólares como por exemplo petróleoporcomida mesmo assim os auditores internos encontraram várias irregularidades entre elas compra de computadores por mil dólares para os escritórios em bagdá sendo que computadores estavam mais e não teriam uso nos escritórios gasto considerado exorbitante de mil dólares com móveis para escritório em bagdá pagamento anual de mil dólares para governo iraquiano para pagar por inspetores de construções que nunca trabalharam para onu compra de seis geradores de energia elétrica diesel mesmo sendo difícil obter diesel na região que seria um custo de milhões de dólares foram gastos uma quantia considerada exagerada de mil dólares com suprimentos de inverno como roupas para população iraque parte
