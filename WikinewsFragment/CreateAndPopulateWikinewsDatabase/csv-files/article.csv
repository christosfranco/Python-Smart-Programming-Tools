based idea power centers find extremely disturbing namely solidarity concern others community fundamental idea social security care whether disabled widow across town food eat kind idea driven people heads people commitment solidarity mutual aid support dangerous could lead concern things like well known example markets provide lots options today crucial options example markets today permit buy one brand car another market permit decide want car want public transportation system choice made available market true wide range issues social significance like whether help disabled widow across

though pretexts worth paying attention questions budget budget called redistributive mean marginally way redistributive extent slightly increasing tax responsibility extremely wealthy top couple percent increase marginal get anywhere near periods high growth rate slightly redistributive ways redistributive effective example allowing workers unionize well known workers allowed unionize want lead wages better working conditions benefits redistributive also helps turn working people political force instead atomized separated working together principle humans function wonderfully least move direction potential legislation table would help unionize employee free choice act obama said favor nothing budget fact nothing budget far tell improving opportunities unionize effective redistributive goal debate right happens morning paper obama accused democrats fact particularly democrats taking much well actually taken much stimulus package mean anybody would tried work little

1954^"interview anna mikkola finnish left alliance candidate european parliament"^"file anna mikkolajpg anna mikkola running european parliament finland member ecosocialist left alliance party age youngest member candidates left alliance list multinational body spoke break campaigning finland votes european parliament election june thanks joining us anna anna mikkola thanks asking convenient break campaign afternoon wn youngest member party list euro elections also extensive career politics already first get involved political activity anna mikkola believe time stopped local party office asked something could general election finland conservatives widely spoke things could accept like public financing culture sports unnecessary one politician even suggested young people could spend time climbing trees expect society provide facilities wn went straight left youth choose party explore others anna mikkola green party left alliance greens felt concentrated much individual life style choices method politics chose left alliance always sort person likes think structures effects big picture social sense may wn like campaigning nationallyelected office like organizing youth locally feel basically different anna mikkola basically different whole country one constituency means traveling people year also expensive election system candidates buy way public knowledge luckily extensive election team covering whole country also financial support left youth movement wn mentioned last night waiting bus seeing three pictures side pass anna mikkola kind absurd ads public transport biggest cities finland definetely conscious traveling bus tram face wn finland role world fundamentally changed lifetime neutral state closer ties soviet union many others democratic europe eu member potentially nato member think youth makes easier adapt changes going anna mikkola well makes relationship finland eu membership definetely easier less emotional maybe many older people finland eu whole adulthood membership question interested looking content think new political generation around year olds making breakthrough going change political discourse substantially wn see green socialist politics key younger generation view environmentalism without socialism anna mikkola interesting green party finland accepted necessity additional nuclear power support market mechanisms part climate policy without questions caveats yes attempt create green capitalist system youth well divided issue many people however see problems turning environment climate action products buy sell speculate sense feel environmentalism separated socialism fundamentally different logic wn end though importance youth vote voter apathy deal situation celebrity candidates particular farright candidates like timo soini anna mikkola european elections problem apathy general youth apathy maybe separate two types many older people vote elections nt like eu andor feel change anything voting since eu big far way choices often resulting considering options many young people vote elections general really even notice apathy result decision genuinely product whle political process something timo soini change think candidacy big risk case since party one man show great extent buries brussels might well end party wn working brussels year stay touch situation finland campaign began anna mikkola mostly visiting finland often two years worked european parliament working parliamentary assistant finnish mep kind means need aware happening finland papers saying wn let talk policy website mention numerous issues lisbon treaty also say eu membership nt eitheror consideration could rewrite lisbon would take would put anna mikkola simply put would take militarisation stuff remove neoliberal economic thinking rules financial markets maybe remove new policy areas would put social progress clause would ensure rights especially worker rights inside eu add recognition eg cross border strikes wn subject militarization would best alternative european defence agency right path collective european defense anna mikkola defense word understood differently different european countries finnish tend understand term passive defense many especially old colonial countries understand active sense including preemptive aggressive operations outside eu borders believe right path firm concentration nonaggressive peacekeeping common european defense idea abovementioned reasons european defence agency basically arms trading operation role would maybe better coordination crisis management peacekeeping wn long run countries europe leave nato well anna mikkola decide however european defence organisation would based nato would respect status nonallied countries believe european union respect wn regard workers rights number parties left raised objections posted workers directive european court justice positions rights workers one eu country working another finland receives foreign workers sends workers elsewhere could posted workers directive best fixed view anna mikkola point fixing directive ecj decisions based treaties override directive actually bad european trade organisations demanding social progress clause mentioned earlier put lisbon treaty would way fix situation rights workers could overriden example free movement services happened ecj decisions wn practical chances clause would put anna mikkola close zero point however lisbon treaty probably last treaty eu course irish still vote second time result time chances would increase widely talked situation eu best get effect treaty negotiated years ago founded economic logic clearly failed seem bother people wn given process taken long think new treaty would present especially current treaty passed national parliaments solid majorities year ago anna mikkola solid majorities finnish parliament started proceedings translation available ratified without public discussion think would clearly appropriate talk since lisbon treaty presented option besides tax payers pay politicians job money one would assume would say nt energy new treaty wn place organized left postlisbon europe would make uncomfortable alliance antieuropean right anna mikkola think alliance would impossible postlisbon eu antieuropean right tends combine act antiimmigration well many cases aggressively think current economic crisis increased risk political right even neofascism could gain people look way express frustration wn wrap best thing next european parliament best thing could next european parliament anna mikkola think best thing would recognise different opinions parliament keen restrict voices likes pretend one happy family politics could want speak try fix problems rights properly dealt eu whether workers rights example net users rights fundamental problem example telecoms package staring point users rights defining going stuff instead starting point
